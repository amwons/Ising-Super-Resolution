# Ising Super Resolution
We use deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to super-resolve classical Ising configurations sampled with standard Monte Carlo methods.
This repository is still under construction. I will update this as I am cleaning up the code I used for the actual project. The CNN implementation is in Keras.

It is possible to change the default loading/saving directories in data/directories.py file.

So far the main scripts are:

train.py: Trains a model. Currently fixed only for critical configurations.
