# Ising Super Resolution
A Keras implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for super-resolving classical Ising configurations sampled with standard Monte Carlo methods.
This repository is still under construction. I update as I am cleaning up the code used for the actual project.

It is possible to change the default loading/saving directories in data/directories.py file.

So far the main scripts are:

train.py: Trains a model.

train_multiple_exponents.py: Runs the training (for critical configurations only) and critical exponent calculation multiple times.
